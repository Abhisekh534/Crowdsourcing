            <p>Crowdsourcing is the collection of information, opinions, or work from a group of people, usually sourced via Internet. Crowdsourcing allows companies to save time and while tapping into people with different skills or thoughts from all over world. Crowdsourcing is going popularity because it is convenient, inexpensive and relatively quick. There are mainly four types of Crowdsourcing:-
            <ul>
                <li>Wisdom of crowd:- It is a collection opinion of different individuals gathered in a group.</li>
                <li>Crowd Creation</li>
                <li>Crowd voting</li>
                <li>Crowd Funding</li>
            </ul>
            Accurate and accessible environment data types plays an important role in formulating effective environmental policy. Data on Air quality, Water quality, Soil Contamination microplastic pollution, and more can reveal insights about how the environment impacts human health in a Community, as well as which communities are most vulnerable to climate changes related threats with the role of mobile phones and sms text-messaging capacity, many members of the general public carry Communication equipments in their pockets at all times.
            Enabling the general public to provide environmental data through text-messages has the potential both to provide additional data to scientific projects and also to provide awareness of the project through participation .
            The crowdsourcing frame work develops a strategy to engage citizens in measuring and learning about the quality of their own drinking water. Through their participation. Citizens provide utilities and water supply agencies with cost-effective water quality data in near-real time. Following a typical Crowdsourcing model, Consumes use their mobile phones to report water quality information through pictures, polls. They can submit their feedback on mobile applications or websites. Messages, dashboards on social media. Individual Citizen can thus be educated about their water quality and stake holders can use data to improve water management.
            Crowdsourced data also been proven effective in time sensitive situations where organisations have limited capacity, such as responding to a natural disaster.
